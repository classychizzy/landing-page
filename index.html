      As i stared out the window, to see the beauty that's outside, the air
      feels warm and the sun shines brightly like the smile of a new born
      baby. Blessed is what describes how i feel this day as i continue to
      stare at objects and people, i noticed the bright faces, the dull ones,
      even the angry ones. There's so much diversity, everyone is busy facing
      life. But i wonder how many of us truly live? How many are priviledged
      to not just live our own lives but be a part of the life of others?

    it's 8:50am, i walk out of the library and i'm on my way to CHM310 class.
    i picture objects but i have no interest in their symmetry cause not all
    objects align perfectly in space. i have interest only in their identity
    (E). something most of us count as trivial. how quick we are to point out
    that objects have this character? but do we as humans know our 'E'? or do
    we follow the trend set by others. A lot of us claim to love our
    ourselves, to love our family, the people around us, to love our dreams.
    But do we really understand the concept of love. "if i give all i possess
    to the poor and surrender my body to flames but have not love, i gain
    nothing" 1 corinthians 13:3.

      Feeling bored is a part of life that each one of us has had his fair share of in life. But our perception of this
      thing called boredom is quite different and this is due to no reason but the fact that we are all excited by
      different things and in a different measure.
